Building
--------

Although ratools is complex from the inside, the code looks very POSIX-ish from
the outside. Thus, bulding is relatively easy. Clone the repository and type
`make`. It is as simple as that!

    $ git clone git@github.com:florianl/distributor.git
      Cloning into 'distributor'...
      [...]
    $ cd distributor/
    $ make
      [...]
